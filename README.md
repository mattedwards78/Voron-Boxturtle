This repo serves as the configuration backup (./printer_data/config) for Voron and Box Turtle . While this repo is public and you are free to pull configurations and macros to use for your own printer, please proceed at your own risk when doing so as it applies specifically to my printer. Not every printer, even ones that are built with the same specifications, share the same configuration.
